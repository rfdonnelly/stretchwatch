= Stretchwatch

A simple stop watch for stretching.

Reports the current "lap" time and the number of "laps."

== History

I wanted a simple stopwatch for stretching.
All I wanted to know was the elapsed of the current "lap" and the number of "laps" I had completed.
However, all the stopwatches I could find reported the total elapsed time and a list of lap times.
